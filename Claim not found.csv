"""covid-19 is a newly emerging, life threatening respiratory disease caused by sars-cov-2, a newly identified human coronavirus [1,2,3,7]. as the seventh human coronavirus and the third most lethal coronavirus, sars-cov-2 has a higher affinity to human receptor ace2 than sars-cov [4,5], and a greater human-to-human transmission capacity than other human coronaviruses [17,18]. because of its newness, communicability, and rapid spread, sars-cov-2 has led to a global pandemic and created great international concern. as of 1 april 2020, 81,691 people in china and 798,200 people in over 200 other countries have been infected with sars-cov-2, and a total of 44,036 individuals have died from covid-19.  transmission of sars-cov-2 appears to mainly occur in the early stage of infection, with higher viral loads in the nasopharyngeal tract, or soon after the symptom-onset of covid-19 [19,20]. early diagnosis, and the timely implementation of intervention and quarantine measures, are crucial to prevent the spread of the virus and optimize clinical management. therefore, the development of simple, rapid and reliable diagnostic assays is of high priority for the prevention and control of covid-19. many rt-qpcr assays have been developed since the outbreak, and contributed to the confirmation of most sars-cov-2 infections during the pandemic in china [3,9,12]. currently, although the covid-19 pandemic has been contained following the strong public health intervention efforts of the chinese government, the virus is spreading quickly outside china, including into some resource-limited areas. the stringent requirements of facilities and professional workers, and its time-consuming nature, limit the use of rt-qpcr assays in some undeveloped countries. furthermore, the presence of asymptomatic infections and the long incubation period of covid-19 increase the difficulty of diagnosis, because some sars-cov-2 carriers may not visit the hospital for diagnosis due to lack of symptoms or signs of infection [21]. therefore, simple, rapid and sensitive poct detection assays, that can be deployed more widely, will be very helpful for the early diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection, and should be developed. one promising poct method, lamp, has been used for the detection of various pathogens because of its high sensitivity, rapid reaction speed, relatively simple operation, and visual determination capability [14,15,22,23]. we recently upgraded the lamp method to a mismatch-tolerant version [14,15]. compared to the conventional lamp method, the novel version contains an additional 0.15 u of high-fidelity dna polymerase, which confers upon it a higher applicability to highly variable viruses, and a 10–15 min faster reaction speed. in this study, we established a rapid and sensitive one-step single-tube rt-lamp assay, for the detection of sars-cov-2 using the mismatch-tolerant technique. the assay can be performed at 63 °c for 50 min in a real-time pcr instrument, for real-time monitoring using fluorescent dye, or for 40 min in a regular pcr machine or heating block (e.g., dry incubator or water bath), for visual detection using ph-sensitive indicator dyes. in the real-time monitoring system, syto9 is used as a fluorescent dye which has a minimal inhibitory effect on lamp amplification [10,14]. in the visual detection system, cresol red is used as a ph indicator dye because of a clear color contrast between negative (red) and positive (yellow) reactions after 40 min of incubation at 63 °c; a color change from red to orange or yellow is defined as sars-cov-2 positive [24].  the novel rt-lamp assay has a high sensitivity, with a lod of 118.6 copies per reaction, and shows no cross-reactivity with 17 common human respiratory viruses, including four other human coronaviruses (oc43, 229e, hku-1 and nl63). in particular, when the template input is more than the lod, the assay has a very fast detection speed of less than 20 min. the robustness of the novel assay was tested using 56 clinical samples from covid-19 patients and control populations in nantong. the novel rt-lamp assay showed a high consistency (92.9%) with a commercial rt-qpcr assay for sars-cov-2 rna detection. there were four samples showing inconsistent results by both the rt-qpcr assay and the novel rt-lamp assay. the reason for two samples testing positive by the rt-qpcr assay but negative by the rt-lamp assay may be the very low copy numbers (having high ct values of >38 in the rt-qpcr assay). however, regarding the other two samples tested positive by the rt-lamp assay (with a high time threshold of >45 min) but negative by the rt-qpcr assay, the reason is speculated to be the presence of viral variants, that have caused mismatches with the primers and/or probe [11,14]. although the sars-cov-2 detection rate in nasal swabs was reported to be lower than in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) and sputum, the high viral load in nasal swabs, combined with easy sampling, will facilitate the early diagnosis of covid-19, especially for mild and asymptomatic infections [20]. in view of a mean viral load of 1.4 × 106 copies/ml in nasal swabs of covid-19 patients, the novel assay is sufficiently sensitive for the detection of sars-cov-2 at an early stage of infection using nasal swab specimens. recently, the nucleic acid extraction-free protocol of the lamp assay was developed by directly adding naoh-treated swabs into the reaction [25]. the rna extraction-free rt-lamp assay for sars-cov-2 should be deployed in the future. in brief, the optimal rt-lamp assay for real-time monitoring is a 25 µl reaction mixture, containing: 1x isothermal amplification buffer; 6 mm mgso4; 1.4 mm dntps; 8 units of warmstart bst 3.0 dna polymerase; 7.5 units of warmstartr rt; 0.15 unit of q5 high-fidelity dna polymerase; 1.6 μm each of primers fip and bip; 0.2 μm each of primers f3 and b3;

"""the covid-19 global pandemic is caused by sars-cov-2, and represents an urgent medical and social issue. unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics. recently, patients have been also treated with off-label therapies which comprise antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents and plasma from convalescent patients, all with controversial results. the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ups) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes. in this review, we discuss several aspects of the ups and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (covs). in fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as mg132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of rna, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for covs. importantly, since ups inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for sars-cov-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response."",0"

"""our data show that the burden of covid-19 goes well beyond just those who test positive for sars-cov-2. this is especially true since the results of sars-cov-2 testing are often only known hours or days after admission and since false negative results are common. even though outcomes were generally worse in those with positive pcr tests, need for icu level of care, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in pui testing negative was still considerable. we also demonstrate how quickly the percentage of pui testing positive for sars-cov-2 increases over time. our most recent data indicate that of all current admissions from the ed, more than two thirds are pui. while many pui can be discharged directly from the ed with a relatively small bounce back rate, a significant percentage of patients are admitted directly to an icu or are later upgraded to an icu within a median of 62 hours. there are also a significant number of pui requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, with most being intubated a median of 60 hours after hospital arrival. thus, for every 100 pui admitted to the hospital, 9 will require immediate icu and/or imv and another 12 will require icu and/or imv within approximately 2-3 days. when intubated, the length of mechanical ventilation is considerable, further contributing to the healthcare burden. as expected, lower oxygen saturations and testing positive for sars-cov-2 were both associated with need for icu, imv, and mortality. male sex and respiratory rate were associated with icu admission while a history of copd, and age were associated with mortality. patients testing positive for sars-cov-2 were more likely to have a known exposure to covid-19, cough, fever, be hispanic, have a smoking history, and be hypoxemic. however, the results of viral testing were often received after the patient had already been intubated, and cannot be relied on to dictate management. we also show that extensive findings on chest imaging (bilateral opacities) are common among pui both with and without viral confirmation, although more common in the former. based on our data, and in an attempt to conserve resources and limit unnecessary contamination of our ct scanner, we have modified our indication for obtaining a ct of the chest. patients with respiratory distress, hypoxia or significant risk with bilateral opacities on a plain cxr do not get a ct. if the cxr is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, particularly in the presence of hypoxemia, dyspnea on exertion, or shortness of breath, a ct scan of the chest is performed. obviously, serial imaging may be required after the patient is admitted based on their clinical course. while most patients discharged from the ed do well, a small minority will revisit the ed, some even requiring subsequent admission, icu care and ventilation. thus, it is important to emphasize to all discharged patients to return immediately to the hospital if their condition worsens. the risk factors we report appear to be somewhat similar to those found in china, italy, singapore, and washington, usa. increasing age and comorbidities have been associated with a greater need for supplemental oxygen therapy, icu admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. 4, 12-20 a prior study found that a history of cardiovascular disease, particularly hypertension was commonly observed in severely ill covid-19 patients. 19 symptoms of fever and cough were also common in confirmed covid-19 cases but not predictive of disease severity. 17 mortality, when expressed as a percentage of pui and or covid-19 patients that die in our cohort is similar to larger studies in china (1.4-4.3%) but lower than that reported from italy and washington state likely due to a younger population and larger cohort. [3] [4] [5] 14 both sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) scores have been shown to be higher in non-survivors (4.5 and 18 respectively) compared to survivors (1 and 14 respectively) while confusion uremia respiratory blood pressure (curb-65) was not significantly different between these groups. 19, 20 the mulbsta score offers an alternate means of risk stratification specific to viral pneumonia with risk factors of age and comorbidity weighted more heavily, consistent with the covid-19 pandemic. 21 our study is one of the largest to date and included not only patients with confirmed covid-19 but also other patients who are being considered as possible covid-19 and who also contribute to the healthcare burden. these patients are often treated similarly to covid-19 patients and must be taken into account to better understand the full scope of the pandemic. it is our sincere hope that this information will help inform other hospitals that are not yet at the epicenter of the pandemic on how best to anticipate and prepare for icu beds and mechanical ventilators. in conclusion, the healthcare burden of the covid-19 pandemic goes way beyond patients who test positive for sars-cov-2. for every 100 pui admitted to the hospital, 9 will require immediate icu and/or imv and another 12 will require icu/imv within 2-3 days, with a median length of mechanical ventilation nearing one week. in general, lower oxygen saturations, and testing positive for sars-cov-2 were associated with worse outcomes. this information should help hospitals anticipate needs for icu beds and mechanical ventilators thus staying ahead of the pandemic curve.

"""we provide the first comprehensive survey of the cardiac adrs associated with hcq, cq, azi or lopi prescribed for covid-19 that have been gathered by the french pharmacovigilance network over one month. our survey reports 120 reports of cardiac adrs, which is way more frequent than what had been notified over more than three decades preceding the covid-19 pandemic in france. for hcq alone, it represents hundred folds the rate of cardiac notifications, reflecting the recent craze for that drug. the resulting surge of its prescriptions yields over a month a raw incidence of ""serious"" cardiac adrs in the range of 0.8 to 2.5%, notwithstanding the strong pharmacovigilance underreporting [24] . even if the controlled environment of hospital use as well as repeated warnings addressed to physicians since march favors adr reporting, such notifications are perceived by doctors as cumbersome in covid-19 intensive care units because health professionals are overwhelmed by their task and most paper files, including ecgs, are also confined in the patients' rooms. furthermore because of a ""regulatory oddity"", adrs occurring in clinical trials are not streamlined by rcpvs, whereas hcq, azi, and lopi are largely used within clinical trials. the incidence of cardiac adrs with hcq, from ~ 1 to 2% is in line with what has been recently published [12] , taking note of strong underreporting. therefore, these 120 hospital reports likely represent ""the tip of the iceberg"" of cardiac adrs, hence those linked to prescriptions by city doctors and other heterodox situations (internet, misuse…). over 80% of the reports are associated with hcq, most of the time associated with azi. this may result from to the wide media diffusion of a possible efficacy of these drugs, even though no conclusive relevant data exists yet [25] . though, cardiotoxicity of hcq and cq is known as they can be considered pharmacologically as ""multi-channel blockers"". both drugs inhibit sodium and calcium currents, and hcq, at least, also blocks the pace-maker current if [26] . all four drugs block cardiac voltage-dependent potassium channels, hence their association with qt prolongation which figures in the respective summary of product characteristics of hcq, cq, lopi and azi. cardiac action potential is the result of finely tuned voltage-dependent ionic channels, allowing cations to circulate sequentially inward and outward cardiomyocytes. the delayed rectifier current (ik) and particularly its rapid component ikr plays a crucial role in outward k + conductance leading to repolarization (fig.   2 ) [27, 28] . by blocking potassium currents, these drugs prolong the cardiac repolarization, thus the duration of the qt interval (fig. 3a) . the latter, as measured on the ecg, reflects the ventricular repolarization by summing all ventricular action potentials. blockade of potassium channels disrupts the electrical homogeneity required to a proper contraction of the heart and yields therefore an arrhythmogenic substrate. this phenomenon facilitates ventricular arrhythmias which may comprise ventricular extrasystoles (fig. 3b) , ventricular tachycardia and the pathognomonic torsades de pointes (tdp) phenomenon (fig. 3c ). tdp is a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia typically triggered by the occurrence of early after-depolarizations (ead) in a setting of an inhomogeneous repolarization [29] . patients treated with hcq associated with azi bear a significant risk of increased qtc [12], over 10% of whom have a ""serious"" qtc prolongation (>500 ms). a brazilian study comparing two doses of hcq associated with azi, led to a premature discontinuation of the high dose arm because of cardiac safety concerns [30] . in addition to its ventricular arrhythmogenic effects, hcq also concurs to bradycardias and av blocks owing to its inhibiting effect of the hyperpolarization-activated funny current (if), which plays a crucial role in the action potential of sinoatrial pacemaker cells [26] . hcq-induced conduction blocks also occurs because of sodium and calcium channels block [17, 31] . protease inhibitors such as lopi are responsible (as a class) for qt prolongation and avblocks as well [32] . as hcq and cq, they block the ether-a-go-go related gene (herg) potassium channel which recapitulates the key potassium current ikr [33] . if the clinical impact of this effect has been debated in the past [34] our study in novel setting of prescription underlines such a risk again. macrolides product labels warn against the risk of qtc prolongation [35] [36] [37] and a small absolute increase in cardiovascular deaths has been described in patients with cardiac comorbidities [38] . azithromycin has been said to block ikr to a lesser level than erythromycin or clarithromycin, but all three prolong experimentally and clinically the qt interval. additional risk factors facilitating cardiac arrhythmias may also play a role in covid-19. whether sars-cov-2 related cardiomyopathy, co-prescriptions of drugs prolonging the qt interval or inducing bradycardia in patients, they further reduce an ailing repolarization reserve [39, 40] . renal-induced hypokalemia is frequent in sars-cov-2 infected patients [41] , and increased incidence of hypomagnesemia should be feared as well through covid-19-induced diarrhea. it has been previously stated that a mere 40% of non-cardiologists correctly measure the qtc [42] , which may be of concern for ""avoidability"" of adrs. automated interpretation of ecgs should remain complementary to the physician's over-read due to its inherent limitations [43] . indeed, we observed a significant discordance not only between computer-estimated (machine read) and clinician-estimated qtcs, but also between the clinicians' and our measurements. this led to significant clinical consequences and is illustrated in our study as hcq was given to a patient with a probable congenital long qt syndrome (lqts) whose baseline qtc was >500 ms. he suffered from ventricular arrhythmia soon after the second intake of 200 mg oral hcq and recovered fortunately after cardioversion. ema and fda have restricted the use of hcq in covid-19 to solely clinical trials. qtc prolongation and subsequent arrhythmogenic risk is the most worrisome adr for these drugs in covid-19 [44] . ecg monitoring is pivotal to mitigate this risk and not only to avoid contraindications. ecg should be checked 3 to 4 hours after drug intake, and twice a week at least to detect qtc prolongations [14, 45] . concomitant treatment with other drugs known to increase qtc and/or induce ventricular arrhythmias, such as seen in our study, should be avoided whenever possible and electrolyte disturbances corrected [14] . like in most pharmacovigilance studies, confounders are present in a significant part of the reports. covid-19 targets several organs besides the respiratory system, including the heart. notwithstanding the drugs of this study, underlying myocarditis could have facilitated the emergence of spontaneous arrhythmias and electrolyte disturbances could have precipitated them as well. subtle page 11 of 22 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 11 channelopathies might have led to individual susceptibility for some rare patients also. all these elements are limits of our study, as in any pharmacovigilance study."",0"
"""tropism is determined by an ensemble of different factors, including the mechanism of viral entry to the host, the immune responses to the infection, or the viral hijacking of the cellular machinery in the interest of replication and propagation. in this article, we study the latter by focusing on the translational adaptation of viral genomes to the host. while previous studies on the base composition and codon usage of both dna and rna viruses 11, 30 have attributed most of the codon usage variability to the mutational pressure of viral genomes, our analysis proposes tropism as an important driving force. by systematically interrogating all human-infecting viruses, we uncover that tissue tropism explains changes in their codon usage more than other viral properties such as type or family. therefore, as mutational pressure would act more similarly within phylogenetically closer species, such tropism-related differences in codon usage suggests that tissue-specific trna expression could be driving a translational selection on viral genomes. although high-throughput sequencing of trnas has been only recently developed, cases of natural selection of codon usage towards the host have been previously proposed. for instance, codon usage of parvovirus has been progressively adapted from dogs to cats after the host jump 43 . influenzaviruses show a similar adaptation over time of viral isolation, deviating from the codon usage of avian hosts 44, 45 . however, whether these progressive changes in codon usage over time are directly driven by translational selection has remained elusive. with the advent of tissue-wide datasets of trnas and their translational efficiencies 2 , we can now compute the supply-to-demand adaptation (sda) of all viral proteomes in different tissues. from there, we then created a random forest model that predicts with high accuracy the viral tropism of proteins based on their profile of adaptation to human tissues. in consequence, the trna-based adaptation profile of a protein is descriptive of their viral tropism, indicating that translational selection could indeed drive tropism differences of codon usage. it is important to remark that viruses could still have a good sda to non-target tissues with similar trna expression patterns that are not infected because they are not exposed to the virus. specifically, we therefore focus our analysis on the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus, causative of the current covid-19 pandemic. as has been recently suggested based on the expression of their entry receptor 21, 22 , sars-cov-2 is also translationally adapted to the upper respiratory airways, as well as the lung parenchyma. this upper tract tropism has indeed been linked to the higher transmissibility of the strain 21 . the novel coronavirus showcases the highest sda among all studied coronaviruses, including lung but also other tissues such as the digestive system and brain. interestingly, recent reports have shown that covid-19 patients very frequently have problems in the digestive tract 24,46,47 as well as in neural tissue 23, 48, 49 . one major open question in the field still persists: how much natural selection before or after zoonosis shapes the current coronavirus 50 . on the one hand, viruses tend to gradually change their codon usage after a zoonotic jump 43, 45 . on the other hand, given the similarity of sars-cov-2 sda with the phylogenetically closest bat coronavirus, it seems that a translational selection to increase sda would have acted before the putative zoonosis from bats or other intermediate hosts. furthermore, in agreement with the highest translational potential of sars-cov-2 in their target tissues, a recent model of viral tropism suggested that a tradeoff exists between the efficiency of viral translation and the translational load on the host, indicating that an improved codon usage can make the difference between symptomatic and natural hosts 51 . on the other hand, it is known that host trna pools undergo reprogramming upon viral infection of hiv-1, vaccinia virus, and influenza a virus 17, 52 . in this context, differences in codon usage between early and late viral genes have been previously reported, but the directionality of such changes remained unclear 10, 53 . based on our concept of tissue-specific adaptation, we therefore validate that early replication-related proteins are better adapted to the tissue of infection. upon infection, we then unveil that changes in trna abundance switch the adaptation towards the expression of late structural proteins, confirming a general trend that had previously only been observed in hiv-1 17 . overall, this is the first systematic analysis establishing a link between the codon usage of human viruses and the translational efficiency of their tissue of infection. this correspondence is particularly observed in early viral proteins, while late counterparts benefit from the trna reprogramming that underlies the process of infection. we therefore envision the development of ad hoc gene therapies specifically targeting the tissue of interest. table 2 for full tcga cancer type

"""the urgent need for effective therapeutic agents against sars-cov-2 has resulted in numerous studies focusing on identifying potential drug candidates. a significant amount of in silico drug discovery reports has been published recently that propose various candidates for drug repurposing against different protein targets of sars-cov-2. most of those studies utilized conventional molecular docking analyses for which the information on the 3d structure of the target is necessary. obtaining a 3d crystal structure for the target proteins is a challenging, expensive, and lengthy process. several artificial intelligence approaches are recently being explored as an alternative that can help researchers find potential drug candidates in a relatively short period even in cases where the 3d structure information is not available. structural similarities between rdrps of several viruses, conservation of key amino acids in the active site as well as identification of broadspectrum anti-rdrp drugs like remdesivir indicated the potential similarity patterns in the chemical structures of effective rdrp inhibitors. this led us to implement supervised machine learning algorithms for the identification of potential rdrp inhibitors. we established a dataset containing small molecules with the experimentally confirmed activity values against rna dependent rna polymerases of hepatitis c virus (hcv), dengue virus, poliovirus, and influenza virus. this dataset was used to train several classification models to be able to ""learn"" the chemical properties of effective rdrp inhibitors. several models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc) score of over 0.8, namely, the graph convolutional network, the message passing network, the random forest classifier (both fingerprint types), the ridge classifier (with circular fingerprints), the lasso classifier (with topological fingerprints), the 3 layered multilayer perceptron (mlp) (with circular fingerprints), and the xgboost classifier (with topological fingerprints). one of them, the random forest classifier on circular fingerprints even surpassed 0.9 in terms of auroc. in terms of accuracy, the best result of 84% was also observed with the random forest classifier (table 1.

"""we have demonstrated a portable chemiluminescent microfluidic elisa system that is able to conduct sensitive detection and quantification of sars-cov-2-related biomarkers in only 15-20 minutes using micro-liter sized sample volumes. the llod of 2 ng/ml for igg in serum was achieved using the humanized chimeric antibodies as the model system. we also successfully characterized different antibodies and identified an antibody candidate, d006, which can be used as the calibration antibody for quantitative evaluation of anti-sars-cov-2 s1 igg. this approach can also be extended to evaluation of therapeutic convalescent plasma. furthermore, we demonstrated sensitive detection of sars-cov-2 s1 protein (antigen) with the llod of 0.4 ng/ml. finally, we showed that our technology can be used as an alternative approach for rapid (8.5 minutes) screening and validation of monoclonal anti-s1 antibodies. our method requires only tens of nanograms, which is several orders of magnitude smaller than used traditional label-free methods (such as bli and spr), and will be useful in screening and selection of high affinity therapeutic neutralization antibodies and research-use antibodies 23, [27] [28] [29] . we will continue to optimize our assays in multiple aspects. for igg detection, we will investigate more humanized or patient-derived sars-cov-2 s1 antibodies to identify optimal calibrators with a high binding affinity and a large linear dynamic range. the differences in the antibodies' affinity against monomeric s1 (most commonly used in antibody and vaccine development) and trimeric s1 (the natural conformation of s1 on sars-cov-2 virus) can also be explored 6 . for s1 protein detection, we will improve the detection sensitivity, since the abundance of sars-cov-2 s1 may be very low in actual patient samples. based on our previous publications 17, 28 , the llod can be greatly enhanced when we replace the hrp-conjugated detection antibody with a biotinylated detection antibody once it become available. for antibody affinity evaluation, we aim to further optimize the assay's protocol (such as adjusting the incubation time and rinsing time) and employ it to evaluate more therapeutic and research use antibodies. our approach also opens a door for other covid-19 related clinical or laboratory researches. for example, the diagnostic value of the covid-19 related biomarkers in serum and saliva (especially s1 specific iga, igm, and viral antigens such as the s1 and nucleocapsid (n) proteins) is currently under intensive evaluation 8, 31, 32 . the igg detection method described in this work can be easily adapted to detect and quantify other types of antibodies such as igm and iga 31, 33, 34 . the concept for sars-cov-2 s1 protein detection can also be adapted to detect other types of viral antigens (such as the sars-cov-2 n protein), as described in figure s5 . direct detection of viral antigens in patient samples such as serum and saliva may facilitate the rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of covid-19 7, 35 . finally, the microfluidic elisa platform can be used to study the neutralization efficacy of therapeutic antibodies 23 (see figure s5 ), as well as for the recognition, evaluation, and phenotyping of natural and recombinant (fake) viral particles 36 . and sars-cov s1 protein (black circles) in 10 times diluted human serum. the averaged background is subtracted from all data points. the solid lines are the linear fit of the data in the loglog scale. the grey shaded area marks 3×standard deviation of the background. the lower limit of detection (llod) for sars-cov-2 s1 protein and sars-cov s1 is 0.4 ng/ml and 0.2 ng/ml, respectively.

"""diabetes is among the most frequently reported comorbidities in patients infected with . according to current data, diabetic patients do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting sars-cov-2 compared to the general population. on the other hand, diabetes is a risk factor for developing severe and critical forms of covid-19, the latter requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or use of invasive mechanical ventilation, with high mortality rates. the characteristics of diabetic patients at risk for developing severe and critical forms of covid-19, as well as the prognostic impact of diabetes on the course of covid-19, are under current investigation. obesity, the main risk factor for incident type 2 diabetes, is more common in patients with critical forms of covid-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. on the other hand, covid-19 is usually associated with poor glycemic control and a higher risk of ketoacidosis in diabetic patients. there are currently no recommendations in favor of discontinuing antihypertensive medications that interact with the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system. metformin and sglt2 inhibitors should be discontinued in patients with severe forms of covid-19 owing to the risks of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. finally, we advise for systematic screening for (pre)diabetes in patients with proven covid-19 infection."",0"
